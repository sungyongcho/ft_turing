# UTM Unary explanation

## Encoding Rule

```json
// original
{
  "name": "unary_add",
  "alphabet": ["1", ".", "+", "="],
  "blank": ".",
  "states": ["A", "B", "C", "HALT"],
  "initial": "A",
  "finals": ["HALT"],
  "transitions": {
    "A": [
      { "read": "1", "to_state": "A", "write": "1", "action": "RIGHT" },
      { "read": "+", "to_state": "B", "write": "+", "action": "RIGHT" }
      { "read": ".", "to_state": "A", "write": ".", "action": "RIGHT" },
    ],
    "B": [
      { "read": "1", "to_state": "B", "write": "+", "action": "LEFT" },
      { "read": "+", "to_state": "A", "write": "1", "action": "RIGHT" },
      { "read": "=", "to_state": "C", "write": ".", "action": "LEFT" },
      { "read": ".", "to_state": "B", "write": ".", "action": "RIGHT" }
    ],
    "C": [
      { "read": "+", "to_state": "HALT", "write": ".", "action": "RIGHT" },
      { "read": ".", "to_state": "C", "write": ".", "action": "LEFT" }
    ]
  }
}
```

The encoding rule to perform this task is as follows:

1. Start with `$`
2. transitions

   - Begin with `#`
   - If active, `*`

3. actions

   - Always begin with `(`
   - If active during the process, it begins with `[`
   - Ordered by value1 -> status -> value2 -> direction
     ex) `(1A1>`

4. Status

   This utm support 3 status (A, B and C).

5. Values

   Since it's unary add, there are 4 character values (1, +, =, .)

6. Inputs

   The inputs of the UTM is written right after `|` character.

```
// encoded
$
*A
  (1A1>
  (+B+>
  (.A.>
#B
  (1B+<
  (+A1>
  (=C.<
  (.B.>
#C
  (+H.>
  (.C.<
```

After encode from json, make one line text on the tape with input.

```
// encode + input
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|111+111=
```

## UTM Workflow

1. Start

To begin the program, locate the `$` symbol.

```
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|111+111=
^
```

2. Read the Value

Move across the tape to find the first value immediately to the right of `|`. Read this value, which determines the transition branch.

```
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|111+111=
                                                     ^

transition name: transition_with_1
```

3. Mark the Value with `?`

```
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
                                                     ^

transition name: transition_with_1
```

4. Locate the Active Transition

Move left to find the active transition, indicated by `*`

```
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
 ^

current status: A
transition name: transition_with_1
```

5. Deactivate the Active Transition

Change the active transition marker `*` to `#`.

```
$#A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
 ^

current status: A
transition name: transition_with_1
```

6. active action 을 찾는다

Use the transition name and current state to determine the next state. Actions begin with `(`, so locate the `(` corresponding to the current value `1`.

```
$#A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
     ^
current status: A
transition name: transition_with_1
next status: A
```

7. Mark the Active Action

Mark the identified action as active by replacing `(` with `[`.

```
$#A[1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
   ^
current status: A
transition name: transition_with_1
next status: A
```

8. Activate the Next State

Mark the next state as active.

```
$*A[1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
 ^
current status: A
transition name: transition_with_1
```

9. Return to the Active Action

Return to the active action marker.

```
$*A[1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
   ^
current status: A
transition name: transition_with_1
```

10. Deactivate the Active Action

Change the active action marker back to `(`

```
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
   ^
current status: A
transition name: transition_with_1
```

11. Identify the Next Action's Value and Direction

Read the value and direction associated with the action, saving it as the transition name.

```
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
       ^
current status: A
transition name: direction_>
```

```
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
      ^
current status: A
transition name: "1>"
```

12. Update the ? Marker

Locate the ?, update its value, and move in the indicated direction.

```
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|?11+111=
                                                     ^
current status: A
transition name: "1>"
```

```
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|111+111=
                                                     ^
current status: A
transition name: "1>"
```

```
$*A(1A1>(+B+>(.A.>#B(1B+<(+A1>(=C.<(.B.>#C(+H.>(.C.<|111+111=
                                                      ^
current status: A
transition name: "1>"
```

Repeat from step 2, continuing the process.
